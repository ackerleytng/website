Hi, I'm Ackerley!

I'm a builder at heart and I enjoy making things that people like to use. In this life, I want to build some language/library/app/system/device that many people will be happy to use.

Coding is a pretty big part of my life.

I also play floorball, draw, (ice)skate, cook, and I wish I could snowboard more often.
