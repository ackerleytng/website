Hi, I'm Ackerley!

I'm a builder at heart and I enjoy making things that people like to use. In this life, I want to build some language/library/app/system/device that many people will be happy to use.

Coding is a pretty big part of my life. The other big parts are family, girlfriend, and other fun stuff.
