I like drawing little cute characters.

### Meet pouchie.

Here's pouchie with a bino, watching the prices on Lenovo outlet.

It's the mascot for one of my projects, [logaze](https://ackerleytng.github.io/logaze/).

Here's pouchie shrugging, the mascot asking [go where ne](https://gowherene.ackerleytng.com)?

And here's pouchie just being pouchie.

I used inkscape to draw pouchie, because inkscape is so precise, so keyboard friendly. I also use inkscape for code documentation, when I need to draw pictures.

### Tree

I drew these with Autodesk Sketchbook on my tablet.
