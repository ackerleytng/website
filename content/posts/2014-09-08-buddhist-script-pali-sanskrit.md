A language has way more than two parts, but let us focus on two:
- writing system
- spoken sounds

English has a few different accents (eg. British, American, Australian) but only one writing system. Chinese (today) has two main writing systems - traditional and simplified chinese - but has a ton of dialects that read the same characters in different ways, and even add characters/have different styles of writing.

Japanese began as a spoken language, and then Chinese characters were borrowed and adapted to represent sounds as well as meaning, which eventually resulted in three sets of characters: hiragana, katakana and kanji.

So at some point I was listening to 王菲's 致青春. And then from the links on the side of the youtube page I found out that she sang the 大悲咒 at one of her concerts! Then I clicked around and found a recording of a CO playing accompaniment for a group of monks chanting the 大悲咒. I found multiple versions of the sutra before finding the one that they were reciting as a comment on the youtube page. Then I realized that the Chinese characters actually have no meaning - they merely provide a sound similar to the original sutra.

(Information mainly from Wikipedia. I hope they're right for now.)

## So what language are the original sutras written in?

First, we want to know how Buddhism developed.

- Siddhartha Gautama was the historical founder of Buddhism, born in Lumbini, Nepal
- Discovered the Middle Way through asceticism and meditation
- Attained enlightenment sitting under the Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, India
- At the Deer Park near Varanasi in Northern India Buddha delivered his first sermon
- Buddha reportedly told his followers that after his death, the Dharma (doctrine, teaching) would be their leader
- Early arhants took great pains to formulate and transmit his teachings accurately, but no ungarnished collection of his sayings has survived

1st Buddhist Council
- Objective was to record all of Buddha's teachings into the sutra and to codify monastic rules (vinaya)
- This became the basis of the Tripitaka, which is preserved only in Pali.

Asoka's edicts
- Were the first tangible evidence of Buddhism
- Written in the Magadhi language in the Brahmi script

Expanded to Sri Lanka
- Theravada prevailed
- Pali canon was written down in Sri Lanka in toto ( = as a whole ) for the first time

Mahayana Expansion
- Spread in the east from India to South-East Asia

Emergence of Vajrayana
- First emerged in eastern India
- Extension of Mahayana Buddhism in that it does not offer new philosophical perspectives, but rather introduces additional techniques

TL;DR: The earliest written version of Buddhist teachings were in Pali, and were written in Sri Lanka.

## Sanskrit

Buddha forbade translation of his discourses into elitist religious languages such as Sanskrit, though eventually these translations were made. Pali became a scholarly and elitist language eventually, which is opposite to what Buddha had explicitly commanded.
