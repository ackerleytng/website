# What is COE?

* COE = Certificate of Entitlement
* Required for registration of new vehicles in Singapore
* Valid for 10 years
* After 10 years, pay Prevailing Quota Premium ( = three-month moving average of the Quota Premium) to revalidate COE for either 5 or 10 years
  * 5-year COEs cannot be revalidated (vehicle is automatically deregistered after that 5 years.

# Bidding system

* Bid through the COE Open Bidding System
* Twice a month
  * First and third Monday at 12pm
  * Ends on the Wednesday at 4pm
* Quota available for bidding is announced before session starts

# Bidding

* Specify reserve price on COE Open Bidding System
* Bid automatically increases until reserve price is reached
* Current COE Price (CCP) must be equal or higher than the reserve price for bid to be in the running
* CCP = highest unsuccessful bid + 1
* At the time that the bidding closes, the CCP becomes the Quota Premium
* All successful bidders pay the Quota Premium
* There is a bid deposit (refunded on unsuccessful bid) of $10000 for categories A, B, C and E. Deposit is $200 for category D.
* There is an admin fee of between $2 and $10 (varies by bank - DBS, OCBC, UOB, MayBank)
* Can revise reserve price upward (not downward). Admin fee applies for each revision.

# Rebate

* COE Rebates are available if vehicle is de-registered before COE expires (pro-rated)
