title: Using Asus RT-AC66R with mio TV
---
The Asus RT-AC66R is a rather popular router! But I guess instructions are lacking. Anyway, here's a post to show that the RT-AC66R can indeed be used with Singtel's mio TV.

Connect the Optical Network Terminal (ONT) to the Asus RT-AC66R's WAN port. Then, connect the mio TV set-top box to the 4th LAN port of the RT-AC66R.

Go to the RT-AC66R's configuration page, and then on the "Advanced Settings" column on the left, select "LAN". Select the "IPTV" tab at the top. For the ISP profile, select Singtel-MIO. (My firmware version is 3.0.0.4.374_979) The table entry for IPTV STB Port should say LAN4. I didn't change the other entries in the "Special Applications" section.

Then, I had to restart my set-top box (like completely power off and start it again) and then it worked.
