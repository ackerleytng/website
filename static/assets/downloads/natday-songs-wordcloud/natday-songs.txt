There was a time when people said
That Singapore will not make it, but we did
There was a time when troubles seemed too much
For us to take, but we did
We built a nation, strong and free, reaching out together
For peace and harmony

This is my country, this is my flag
This is my future, this is my life
This is my family, these are my friends
We are Singapore, Singaporeans

Singapore our homeland, it is here that we belong
All of us united, one people marching on
We have come so far together, our common destiny
Singapore forever, a nation strong and free

This is my country, this is my flag
This is my future, this is my life
This is my family, these are my friends
We are Singapore, Singaporeans

We the citizens of Singapore
Pledge ourselves as one united people
Regardless of race, language or religion
To build a democratic society
Based on justice and equality
So as to achieve happiness
Prosperity and progress for our nation

We are Singapore, we are Singapore
We will stand together, hear the lion roar
We are Singapore, we are Singapore
We are a nation strong and free forevermore

We are Singapore, we are Singapore

We have built a nation with our hands
The toil of people from a dozen lands
Strangers when we first began, now we are Singaporean
Let us reach out for Singapore, join our hands forevermore

One people, one nation, one Singapore
That is the way that we will be forevermore
Every creed and every race, has its role and has its place
One people, one nation, one Singapore

And when the time comes for the test
Our vigilance will never rest
We will be united, hand in hand
We will show the world just where we stand
And reach out for Singapore, join our hands forevermore

Whenever I am feeling low
I look around me and I know
There is a place that will stay within me
Wherever I may choose to go
I will always recall the city
Know every street and shore
Sail down the river which brings us life
Winding through my Singapore

This is home truly, where I know I must be
Where my dreams wait for me, where the river always flows
This is home surely, as my senses tell me
This is where I will not be alone, for this is where I know it is home

When there are troubles to go through
We will find a way to start anew
There is comfort in the knowledge
That home is about its people too
So we will build our dreams together
Just like we have done before
Just like the river which brings us life
There will always be Singapore

This is home truly, where I know I must be
Where my dreams wait for me, where the river always flows
This is home surely, as my senses tell me
This is where I will not be alone, for this is where I know it is home

For this is where I know I am home

The moment when I was born
Into this world, into my home
I recall when I was young
Stars and Crescent shine on me

In my heart lies my homeland
I share this joy with my families and friends
Let our strength build on and on
Reaching out to the world

Stars and Crescent shine on me
Make us more than what we can be
All our dreams come true
As we all grow stronger

Stars and Crescent shine on me
Turning our hopes, into reality
For we will always be
Shining as one

Let our hopes lead us afar
Into the world, to be the best
There is so much to reach out for
Stars and Crescent shining on

In my heart lies my homeland
I share this joy with my families and friends
Stepping out into a New World
As we make our choices

Stars and Crescent shine on me
Make us more than what we can be
All our dreams come true
As we all grow stronger

Stars and Crescent shine on me
Turning our hopes, into reality
For we will always be
Shining as one

Morning comes around and I
Cannot wait to see my sunny island
In its glorious greenery, whether rain or shine, it is still beautiful
Bright lights shine on the streets at night
Guiding me closer to home
To a place where I will be safe and warm, where I belong

Friends and families by my side
Seeing me through as I grow and learn
Every day's experience, bitter sweet or sour
They are still wonderful
As they become precious memories
They will be kept close to my heart
And no matter where I am I will always know, where I belong

Where I belong, where I keep my heart and soul
Where dreams come true for us
Where we walk together hand in hand towards a future so bright
Where I belong, where I keep my heart and soul
Where we are one big family
I want the whole world to know, I want to shout it out loud
That this is where I know I belong

Where I belong, where I keep my heart and soul
Where dreams come true for us
Where we walk together hand in hand towards a future so bright
Where I belong, where I keep my heart and soul
Where we are one big family
I want the whole world to know, I want to shout it out loud
That this is where I know I belong

I want the whole world to know, I want to shout it out loud
That this is where I know I belong



Remember the days, we set out together with faith?
Remember the times, so fine, when we thought that
Nothing could stand in our way?

Then things were not the same, the life that we knew had to change
We have struggled through, the darkest storms
We thought we could not tame

Together we have tried, as we stood side by side
I knew we would build a new world
A world of hope for ever after

Deep in my heart I just know
Right from the start, we will grow
Look where we are, we have come so far
And there is still a long, long way to go

With all of my heart, I will care
I will play my part, I will share
With family and friends, together we will stand
And in the end, hand in hand
We will get there

So now we begin, working together to win
Believing in trust, it must
Be possible to overcome anything

There is so much to do, there is so much we can contribute
By sharing just a little love
We will start again anew

So why do not we try? If we stand side by side
I know we will build a new world
A world of hope for ever after

Deep in my heart I just know
Right from the start, we will grow
Look where we are, we have come so far
And there is still a long, long way to go

With all of my heart, I will care
I will play my part, I will share
With family and friends, together we will stand
And in the end, hand in hand
We will get there

Deep in my heart I just know
Right from the start, we will grow
Look where we are, we have come so far
And there is still a long, long way to go

With all of my heart, I will care
I will play my part, I will share
With family and friends, together we will stand
And in the end, hand in hand
We will get there

At a time when hope was low
The journey seemed unsure
But through it all
We have kept the flame alive

Now standing proud and tall
Our spirit strong and free
Building on hopes and dreams

With wings we soar up high
Our dreams we will all achieve
We will make our destiny

This is my home
She is everything to me
Grace and beauty
In all that you see

My island home
Wherever I may be
I never will forget her
Nor will she forget me

And I will sing
A song of home
A land of peace
Where dreams are born every day
My home
Wherever I may be
I believe
You will always be a part of me

My island home
Home of my family
This is my future
Where I want to be

This is my home)

My home
Wherever I may be
I believe
You will always be a part of me

I have walked the streets of Cairo and Bombay
I have seen the neon signs on old Broadway
I have climbed the Eiffel Tower
The Great Wall in one hour
Experienced sweet and sour but that is okay

Seen Hollywood, the sunsets in LA
The London Bridge, Big Ben, The Thames, UK
I have crossed the River Kwai
Yet still I do not know why
I think of you each night and every day

There is no place I would rather be
You will always be a part of me
And even though I have roamed the world
It is still my home I long to see

This is where my family
And my friends grew up with me
So I will cross the skies and sail the seas
To be where I wanna be

There is no place I would rather be
You will always be a part of me
And even though I have roamed the world
It is still my home I long to see

This is where my family
And my friends grew up with me
So I will cross the skies and sail the seas
To be where I wanna be

Because there is no place I would rather be



Have you seen a star,
One that guides you no matter where you are?
However vast the sky may be
Or dark it seems
You can be sure, it is always there for you and me

Have you heard a song,
One that moved you, one that made you sing along?
Your dreams and hopes will all come true
If you believe that every vision begins with you.

Shine for Singapore
This is your song,
Deep inside your heart where it belongs
It will always stay. Strive for your goals,
You will achieve with visions so bold.

Shine for Singapore
This is our song
Reach out for the sky, far and beyond
As one we will stand, we are Singapore
It is here that we belong

There is a jewel on the ocean,
a gem upon the sea
Where the future is an open book
A land of destiny
We could set our sights into the wind and sail the seven seas
or climb the highest mountain top as long as we believe
What do you see? What do you see?

See the moon and the stars, look how far we have come
Look around at our faces, they shine brightly in the sun
With our hopes and dreams, imagine what tomorrow it may bring
What do you see? What do you see?

Now the time has come to reach out,
To open up to see
That we stand together in this land
Because we are family
As thoughts of reaching to the sky are carried on a dream
With hearts and minds united, our dreams we will achieve
What do you see? What do you see?

See the moon and the stars, look how far we have come
Look around at our faces, they shine brightly in the sun
With our hopes and dreams, imagine what tomorrow it may bring
What do you see

What do you see when life makes you take on a mountain
You will see that nothing is going to stand in your way
Together we can share
The strength of a million
and the courage of a million more

See the moon and the stars, look how far we have come
Look around at our faces, they shine brightly in the sun
With our hopes and dreams, imagine what tomorrow it may bring
Because the sky is the only limit when you are not afraid to dream
What do you see? What do you see...



It is a brand new day a brand new story
I remembered the way it used to be
We have come so far

And you carried me this far

First light rolls across my peaceful isle,
Mornings, I wake up, refreshed, renewed,
Ready to meet the bright new day,
So much to look forward to.

Day light, the city has stirred to life,
Your smiles put a spring in my step,
There is a feeling that binds us one and all,
different stories, shared memories.

I love my city's lively ways,
Warm sunny days,
Sights and sounds, special tastes that add up to this place,
I love my friends my closest ties,
Now I finally realise,
When it feels this right, you know that it is love at first light.

Night fall, stars twinkling on the bay,
My dreams can take flight if I dare,
There is a feeling that binds us one and all,
We look forward to a brighter day.
